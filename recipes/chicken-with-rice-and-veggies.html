            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set your oven to 425F</li>
                <li>Line two oven safe trays with aluminum foil and spray them down with Vegitable oil.</li>
                <li>Gather your veggies and then sliced the pepper into strips</li>
                <li>Afterwards, cut the potato into about 1/2 inch chunks.</li>
                <li>Combine your veggies in a bowl and toss with Olive oil, then salt and pepper.Afterwards, put them on one of the trays and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Grab your chicken breast and make sure the fat is trimmed off and the bones are removed. Cut the breast into three somewhat equal parts and flatten the pieces out a little with your hand or the knife.Rub EVOO on them, then salt and pepper. Set it on the other tray. </li>
                <li>Grab the rice and wash the starch off while having the water boiling. Add some salt the water, about 1/4 teaspoon.When the water is ready, add the rice and cover it. Reduce heat to low and set a timer for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the veggies and chicken in the oven and set a timer for 20 minutes.I would clean up and doom scroll while I wait.</li>
                <li>When rice is done, fluff it and put it aside to cool. Then when 20 minutes is up, remove the chicken and set a timer for 10 minutes. Make sure the chickens temp is 165F.</li>
                <li>After the 10 minutes, pull the veggies out. You should be able to stick a fork in the potatoes very easily. Combine the them with the rice on bottom, then veggies and topped with the chicken!</li>
