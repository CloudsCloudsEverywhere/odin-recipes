       <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A simple <em>healthy</em> dinner composed of oven roasted chicken with roasted veggies and a side of rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>about a 0.75lbs of chicken breast, trimmed and cut.</li>
            <li>1 white potato, washed and diced</li>
            <li>1 cup of broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 cup of rice</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of water</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin Olive oil (EVOO)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                
                <li>Preheat oven at 350F. Line two oven safe trays with aluminum foil and spray them down with Vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>Gather your veggies, then sliced the pepper into strips and cut the potato into about 1/2 inch chunks. Combine your veggies in a bowl and toss them with EVOO, salt and pepper. Afterwards, spread them out on a tray and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Grab your chicken breast and make sure the fat is trimmed off and the bones are removed. Cut the breast into three somewhat equal parts and flatten the pieces out a little with your hand or the knife. Rub EVOO on them, then salt and pepper. Set it on the other tray. </li>
                <li>Grab the rice and wash the starch off while having the water boiling. Add some salt to the water, about 1/4 teaspoon. When the water is ready, add rice and cover it, then reduce heat to low and set a timer for 15 minutes. Put the veggies and chicken in the oven and set a timer for 20 minutes. I would clean up and doom scroll while I wait.</li>
                <li>When 15 minutes is up, fluff rice with a fork and set it aside to cool. When 20 minutes is up, remove the chicken and set a timer for 10 minutes. Make sure the chickens temp is 165F.</li>
                <li>After the 10 minutes, pull the veggies out and you should be able to stick a fork in the potatoes easily. Combine the them with the rice on bottom, then veggies and topped with the chicken!</li>
